          My name is Alexia Valdez and this is my second year here at Colorado State University-Pueblo. I am a Buisiness Management major with and emphasis in Marketing and a minor in Media Communication. Recently, I was elected one of Associated Student Governments Senators-at-large for CSU-P for the Fall 2021 semester. After starting as a campus student ambassador my freshman year, I earned the position of Assistant Team Lead. During my junior year of high school I began working at our local Cold Stone Creamery, and am now in a store manager position.
